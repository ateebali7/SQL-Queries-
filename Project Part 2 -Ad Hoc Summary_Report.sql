-- 2. Is LetsMeet membership leveling off?
/*
- According to the data, LetsMeet memberships seems to be leveling off. There was a total of 11,721 members that joined in 2017 which was only an increase of 510 members compared to the 11,211 members that joined in 2016. 
- The Difference in members joined in 2016 and 2015 was 2,287 members, which is significantly higher then the difference of 2017 and 2016. 
- LetsMeet took its biggest jump in members joined in 2015 with a total of 8,924 members, the year before 2014 only had 3,970 members join. That is an increase of 4,954 memberships. 
- Chicago, San Francisco, and New York were all similar with no significant changes in memberships from 2016-2017. 
- 2017 was further examined and we found that the last 2 months of the year had the lowest numbers of members joined. November with 240 members and December with only 13 memberships compared to the first month of the year with 1,179 memberships. 
- There was a pattern of increasing membership but since 2016 and 2017, membership does not seem to growing like it used to. This can potentially be due to less groups being created in the LetsMeet network, maybe if more groups are created there is a chance for new members to join hence increase membership in LetsMeet.
